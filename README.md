# NasaDummyApp
NasaDummyApp is, guess what, a dummy app in **Android** that I developed in order to learn something new about the Droid world and keep myself updated with the lastest trends in the native universe. 

## Software Architecture Pattern
I tried to use MVVM for the first time in order to make the code more readable, scalable and easily testable in the future.

## Libraries
I tried to use the most important libraries for handling the whole app's stack and testing:
 1. Android Jetpack ( ViewModels, LiveData, Navigation )
 2. RXJava
 3. Retrofit
 4. Kotlin Coroutines
 5. Moshi
 6. JUnit and Mockk

## Sooo...what's its purpose? 

As for now, it's only a showcase that sums up how I learned to use all these important libraries that are necessary to develop a state of the art app.
